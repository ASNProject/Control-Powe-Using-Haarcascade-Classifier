# Control-Power-Using-Haarcascade-Classifier
The purpose in this project, i want to control power in the room with human detection. If any human in the room the power will ON, but if not any human in the room the power will OFF.

I make the project with EMGUCV and C#. I also make the Graphic User Interface (GUI) to facilitate the user.
